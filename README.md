# Housing Prices Prediction (Kaggle)

## Project Overview
This is my first Machine Learning project based on the Kaggle **House Prices** competition.
The objective is to predict house prices using supervised regression models.

## Project Structure
- `train.csv` : training dataset (features + target `SalePrice`)
- `test.csv` : test dataset (features only)
- `submission.csv` : predictions generated for Kaggle submission
- `housing_prices.ipynb` : notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and prediction

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering and encoding
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Prediction on test data
7. Submission file generation
